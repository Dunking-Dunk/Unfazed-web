        description: "There is an admin dashboard for administrators to create, edit, and manage entire shipments. Administrators can also manage supervisors and drivers from the dashboard. They can assign and manage vehicles in real-time with their live location and live data from the telematics control unit (TCU).An Internet of Things (IoT) device called a telematics control unit (TCU) collects data like engine RPM, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions from all vehicles, trains, trucks, and ships. This data is sent to the dashboard for analysis through graphs and charts. The system has incorporated AI technology that predicts further relevant data based on the input data from the telematics control unit Administrators can manage wagons individually carrying coal using load cells that measure the weight of each wagon and also detect if the weight is overloaded, underloaded, or the correct load. All these data are displayed in the dashboard in real-time, showing the live weight status of each wagon. Administrators can remotely monitor coal loading across wagons and identify any issues.Shipments are divided into sub-shipments based on the mode of transport - train, truck, or ship. The dashboard automatically detects and updates vehicle/license plate numbers when the transport mode changes and when the shipment is completed.",
